<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Shortly after I graduated from University, I realized that the aspect of business that I enjoyed most is to focus on strategy itself -- from an almost abstract perspective. In a weird way, I found that many of my favourite things to do involve being or studying the "behind the scenes". To put it inelegantly, I like to spend all of my time understanding how the sausage is made, and making the sausage itself. This realization made sense - I often mainly enjoyed movies not for the plot nor the spectacle, but for asking and answering the simple question: How did they do that? As a child my favourite shows included <i>How it's Made, Bill Nye the Science Guy,</i> and <i>Magic School Bus</i> - all educational shows centered around pulling back the curtain on the world around you.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">From this revelation I decided to embark on finding as many books on learning strategy as its own, distilled study as I could. It turns out that doing so was not as simple as typing <i>strategy</i> into my library website and clicking <i>Search</i> -- strategic studies are typically framed under specific contexts, most notably military and individual games such as chess and poker.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While I was perfectly happy drawing my own conclusions from these context-specific books, I still wanted to know where all of the strategic study materials were. Were they all under <i>Game Theory</i>? Perhaps it was simply found in the intro courses of <i>Strategic Studies</i> curriculums at specific universities. I had even considered that the journey may have to start under Logic and Modes of Reasoning courses, drawing from my general education courses at York University. It is then when I stumbled upon Richard Rumelt's <i>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</i> </p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</i> is mainly framed by business strategy (large and small), however also makes a point to develop concepts by employing military examples and abstract reasoning. While my initial goal was to approach strategy from an abstract perspective, it was ideal to frame it mainly through business given that it is the realm I am most interested and focused on.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">As partially informed by Goodreads reviews, Rumelt's writing style comes off as abrasive at times, and perhaps even arrogant. The book is written such that it seeks to dash away preconceived notions of strategy, and is prepared to challenge its readers on their assumptions. A large number of examples within the book are written from Rumelt&rsquo;s perspective as a challenging adversary to his students and even his consulting clients. It is from these examples that many ideas and conclusions are drawn about where strategy tends to falter. Leadership and strategy are realms that experience plenty of <i>"cultural noise"</i> as to how to approach any given situation, and so Rumelt's curmudgeonly writing style steps in to cut through the all-too-common shallow platitudes and rigid doctrines often faced in this topic.</p>

<div style="font-family:courier;"><blockquote><i>"The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action."</i></blockquote></div>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The book can be broken down into 3 main parts:</p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c13 c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7"><b>PART I: GOOD AND BAD STRATEGY</b> </span><span>deals with the main concepts of what defines a </span><span class="c7">good</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c7">bad</span><span>&nbsp;strategy, and reframes case studies within this context. This section also introduces the concept of a </span><span class="c7">Strategic Kernel </span><span class="c5">as a way of formulating strategy, which carries throughout the book as a central means of analyzing more complex cases.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7"><b>PART II: SOURCES OF POWER</b> </span><span>is where the book spends most of its time, breaking down individual aspects of strategic focus. While Part I was more deeply focused on the simplicity of avoiding the follly of </span><span class="c7">Bad Strategy</span><span class="c5">, Part II seeks to provide an academic look at what considerations are made for any given strategy. In this sense, Part II is where the book transforms from a useful guide on heuristic aspects of strategy into a fascinating study of what strategy really is.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c13"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7"><b>PART III: THINKING LIKE A STRATEGIST</b> </span><span>is more case-heavy and applies the previous sections in full-force. It is a more abstract part of the book in that it seeks to combine the academic aspects of strategy with the chaos of human bias, the complexity of real-life situations, and the uncertainty of making decisions under time constraints.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>For the sake of being thorough, I have included a table below that outlines the chapters as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><a id="t.d878b86b266555a164f1e158b2772572b8dbb93b"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Part I: GOOD AND BAD STRATEGY</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 1 - Good Strategy is Unexpected</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 2 - Discovering Power</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 3 - Bad Strategy</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 4 - Why so much bad strategy?</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 5 - The Kernel of Good Strategy</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Part II: SOURCES OF POWER</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 6 - Using Leverage</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 7 - Proximate Objectives</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 8 - Chain-Link Systems</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 9 - Using Design</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 10 - Focus</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 11 - Growth</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 12 - Using Advantage</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 13 - Using Dynamics</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 14 - Inertia and Entropy</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 15 - Putting it Together</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Part III: THINKING LIKE A STRATEGIST</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 16 - The Science of Strategy</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 17 - Using Your Head</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chapter 18 - Keeping Your Head</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">I found that this book was an excellent jumping-off point for looking at the world from a strategic perspective, as its focus on challenging assumptons while providing a simple framework with which to analyze situations. Its focus on cases allows for an engaging learning environment that eases the reader into understanding what to look for in real-life situations. Furthermore by focusing on the importance of striving for simplicity, it demystifies a lot of the bravado typically surrounding discussion about strategy.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While the book is not a strict and quantitative approach to strategy, it acts as an excellent introduction to strategy while also acting like a handbook for planning and analyzing. It emphasizes the human and realistic aspects of strategy while challenging typical doctrines and assumptions often associated with leadership.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Since I have read this book, I have found that it has become easier to understand other, more esoteric reading material based around strategic discussion and concepts. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject or who finds themselves in a competitive environment.</p>
